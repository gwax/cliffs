        PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS PROPOSING IDEAS FOR THE CLIMBING GAME
        THAT, LEST THEY BE FORGOTTEN, CAN BE RECORDED HERE.



Here is from about November-December 1991

        CRUMBLING LEDGES and FALLING ROCKS  _ George

        A bivouac site where how you get along with your tent companion
        determines your "fitness" the next day and, ultimately, your
        abitility to make it to the top.

        Ledges that get harder to see as it gets dark. Setting a time a
        time limit on how long you can stay on the cliff.

        A rope and a companion. Belays.
        Selection of equipment.

        The logistics of organizing an expedition (and of getting the
        party through the lowlands without getting diarrhea).
        The specific computer program described by Bonnington for 
        determining when, how and what was needed to be carried.

        "They should get a reward for getting to a certain stage...
        You get to have dinner with the president" _ Barb
        You and 500 other celebrities have dinner with the president and the
        first lady, and get to shake their hands.

        Implement clocks and timers

        Limb fatigue and permanent damage

        Organizing the program around the "expedition" concept

        View of the hills: distant, medium and close.
        A way of looking up and down from up on the cliff.

        Moving both men simultaneously.


2/5/92

        The idea of playing a tetrus-like game in the bivouac site, in order
        to not spill the tea on a sleeping bag or set the tent on fire.

        ice climbing and its special technology

2/28/92
        In the intro it may say:

        As you climb not only will you be battling with the elements, the
        difficulty of the terrain and with your own self confidence.
        You will also be battling with some curious and unexplained events
        such as an occasional broken rope or rescue from an impossible fall.
        You may choose to think of these events as acts of God. We prefer to 
        think of them as just "Bugs in the program"...and in fact God has
        informed us that all such events are untintentional.
