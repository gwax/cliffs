        To belay rope to ledge use:

                left     <e>                   right    <i>
                hand                           hand

        Note1: To be supported the man must have either the rope attached
        or a leg and some other limb. For example 2 arms and no rope will
        not support.

        Note2: The color of a belay dot determines if the attachment is a 
        fixed knot or a sliding one:  yellow=fixed  blue=sliding.

        Note3: You can only climb up the rope when your arms are centered.

        Note4: You can hit movement keys simultaneously for moving limbs
        simultaneously; also you can hit keys quickly in sucession to make
        complex movements.

THE MOVING MAN:
                In the game the moving man is highlighted in yellow, you
        can select which man to move: using <F1> to select PeterB and 
        <F2> to select DougalH.

THE MOVEMENT DIRECTION:
                Select a direction of movement using the arrow keys
        (left, right, up or down). An arrow displayed on the lower 
        right of the screen shows the current movement direction.
        When the movement direction is up or down it is said to be 
        a "vertical" direction; when the movement direction is left or 
        right it is called a "horizontal" direction.

MOVEMENT KEYS:
                Each limb is controlled by its own pair of keys. These
        two keys will move the limb up and down (if moving in a vertical
        direction) or left and right (if moving in a horizontal direction).
        The four pairs of keys are as follows:

                 q                            p
                  a   s                  k   l
                        x              m

       Where:
                q = left hand up (out)
                a = left hand down (in)

                s = left foot up (out)
                x = left foot down (in)

                p = right hand up (out)
                l = right hand down (in)

                k = right foot up (out)
                m = right foot down (in)


BELAY KEYS:
                To attach the rope to the moving man or to a ledge use
        the following "belay" keys. Hitting the same key a second time
        will either release the rope or turn a fixed belay into a sliding
        one. Each belay is represented by a colored dot. Dots on the
        ledges represent "pitons". Dots at the bottom of the screen next
        the names of the men represent the status of (respectively) the 
        left hand, body and right hand. Blue dots represent belays which 
        are sliding, yellow dots represent belays which are fixed. These
        keys are:

                 w  e                  i o

                              b

         Where:
                w = left hand grasp/release rope
                e = left hand attach rope and piton to ledge

                b = body grasp/release rope

                o = right hand grasp/release rope
                i = right hand attach rope and piton to ledge


QUITTING:
                Hit <esc> to quit.


RULES OF SUPPORT:
                In order to climb safely with no rope you need to always 
        have at least one foot and one other limb touching a ledge. When you 
        are tied fast to the rope it will give all the support you need to 
        stay up. However, if you are tied only by a sliding belay, it will 
        not support you.
                You may want to raise and lower the rope ends, different
        effects result from different uses of the body belay: fixed, sliding
        or off.
                If you fall on the rope and swing, you can climb back up 
        the rope, but your arms must be centered. At the extremity of each
        swing you have a chance to make a grab for something.

LEDGES:
        The ledges used are contained in a file called "ledges".
        If you wish to try differnt ledges, use the editor ed.exe
        to create new ledges. Rename the resulting file "ledges",
        and it will replace the old ledges with the new one.
        Two sample ledges are included: ledges and ledges.tmp
        Try copying ledges.tmp to ledges. Try getting up that!


HINTS:
                - Use simultaneous limb movements
                - When stuck, try double clicking movement keys.
                - Try using the rope creatively.
