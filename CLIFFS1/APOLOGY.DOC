        The Game Rationale

                Games are fun which simulate an activity which is fun;
                like exploring, fighting, flying, playing ball, or (as in 
                the case  of "Attack the Cliffs") climbing. A computer 
                climbing game would be the most natural game imaginable.
                IF YOU CAN GET THE KEYSTROKES RIGHT! (see below)

                There is a fascination in mountaineering literature: the 
                drama of the rising action, climax and falling action. 
                The danger. The accidents: escape from them or tragedy.

                The innumerable scenarios and subplots.
                
                The possibility of describing actual climbs such as the 
                Eiger north face.

                Markets in sporting goods stores as well as software 
                stores; opening up new distribution channels.

        The Keystrokes and Interface
                
                The kestrokes are not easy at first, there is an athleticism
                or dexterity needed to get up a cliff in the time allowed. 
                It is also like playing the piano. It takes a while to learn,
                and this is contrary to some computer game philosophies.
                However these difficult keystrokes attempt to simulate the 
                difficult climbing moves which make climbing interesting.

        By the way, I consider the keystrokes to be the main copywritable
        concept in this game. Explicitly: I believe that "factoring" the
        movement into a direction choice (the arrow keys) and a +/- choice
        (made by the pair of keys for each limb) is an elegant solution
        to how to control stick figures from the keyboard.
